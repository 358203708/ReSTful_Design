                <p>In order to allow users to loan books in the library system, some endpoints and tags are addded in this existing system.</p>
                <!-- <p>The new endpoints and tags are shown below</p>
                <img src="_image/accounts_new.png" alt="accounts_new.png" width="900" height="390" align="center">
                <img src="_image/books_new_tags.png" alt="books_new_tags" width="250" height="130" align="center">-->
                <p>And the state diagram of the loan system below illustrates how the request processed by the loan system when the user sends a loan request.</p>
                <img src="_image/Loan%20system%20state%20diagram.png" alt="Loan%20system%20state%20diagram" align="center">
                <p>First of all, the loan system has to ensure the book users want to loan is available, so the system checks the value of the tag &#123;availability&#125;. If the valuse is true, then process to next step, or give the user a response: request rejected.</p>
                <p>When the book is available, the system verify the user's account id, if user's account id is not valid, the system redirects to a webpage for registeration.</p>
                <p>If the user has a valid account, the loan system needs to check the value of the tag &#123;loans quantity&#125;. If the user has less than 10 active loans, the request moves to next procedure, or the loan system redirects to the webpage for returning books.
                </p>
                <p>If the value of tag &#123;fine state&#125; is true, it means that the user owes a fine and he needs to pay the fine before loaning a book. If the user does not owe a fine, he is qualified to loan books.</p>
                <p>Finally, the system needs to add some loan detail to book and user's account, then give a response: book loaned to the user. In other words, some values of tags (e.g. avaliablity, loan date, due date) are changed when the user loans a book.</p>
